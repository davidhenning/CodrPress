CodrPress is a small and lightweight blogging system inspired by [Schnitzelpress](https://github.com/hmans/schnitzelpress).

## Differences to Schnitzelpress

Schnitzelpress is written in Ruby and designed as a Heroku app. CodrPress is a PHP based application.

## Smiliarities to Schnitzelpress

Both use MonogDB as database. Instead of using a richtext editor to write blog posts, both use [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and feature really beautiful syntax highlighting out of the box.

## Technology

CodrPress is build on top of [Silex](https://github.com/fabpot/Silex), a simple web framework based on Symfony2 components and the [Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig) template engine.
